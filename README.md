This is a collection of my work done for Introduction to Software Development taken Spring 2018. The course was an introduction to the solution of problems on a digital computer using the Java language. Object-oriented programming concepts; documentation techniques; design of test data. Writing, debugging, and running programs in an interactive computing environment.

From my work, you should be able to see the following:

-Familiarity with key concepts in a procedural programming language such as: variables, data types, control structures, methods, input and output.

-The ability to use programming to solve problems appropriate to a beginning class in programming and software development.

-Familiarity with rudimentary processes of software development that include: design, coding, testing, and debugging.
